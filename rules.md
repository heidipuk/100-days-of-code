# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will set aside at least one hour a day to become a better developer.*

#### Start Date
May 18th, 2019.

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every week -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work that time won't count towards the challenge, unless it is something completely new.
4. I will update the [Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress when possible.
5. Time spent writing code (that being both for real projects and tutorials) count towards this challenge along with reading books and blogs on development and listening to relevant podcast.
6. For each day I don't fulfil the challenge I will add three days to the total duration


## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
TBD
