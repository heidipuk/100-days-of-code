# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Read chapter 7 and 8 in "Clean Code" ("Error handling" and "Boundaries"). Finish `Common table expressions using WITH` in Team Treehouse

**Thoughts:** The point to handle errors at the end of a function in stead of on location fits very well with my own experiences. I have had to do a few `do-catch` clauses lately and the really mess up the code (in my opinion). Another point is the `never return NULL` in a function. I find his arguments interesting, but at the same time I'm not completely sure agree with it (when it comes to swift). It is a point I will have to follow up on.  
The chapter on "Boundaries" was a bit abstract in my opinion, but one detail do I take from it; The idea of writing `learning tests`. It is an approach I have used a few times in the last month or so, and I want to use it more in the future. One of my issues with writing tests has been that the keep failing on Linux, I did however find the issue the last time I wrote tests, so I hope this will not be a personal blocker in the future.  
I have been working a lot on extending my understanding of SQL in the first few months of 2019 and although I have been a bit lazy with practising in my free time the last two months I have had to use it a lot at work lately. Today I practiced a to me new feature in SQL, `CTE - common table expressions`. To sum it up, it is to move subqueries out into separate expressions and then use them in the final query. A pretty powerful feature.
